# PromptWorld

PromptWorld is a cross-platform application that allows users to organize collections of photos or video frames into an approximate 3D virtual space. It provides simple tools for positioning and rotating images as 2D planes in 3D, without requiring advanced 3D modeling techniques. Integrated AI generates detailed descriptions of the images, enabling users to create a rough "world model" that can be queried or prompted via natural language for tracking, managing, or simulating changes in environments. This app serves as a precursor tool for conceptualizing future interactions with real-world spaces through prompts.

The app is designed with a web-first approach using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS (leveraging CSS3D for 3D rendering), ensuring maximum code sharing. It runs natively in web browsers and on Android via a thin Java WebView wrapper.

**Key Goals:**
- Approximate 3D organization of images.
- AI-powered image descriptions.
- Natural language prompting for model interaction.
- Utility for environment management and simulation.

**Target Platforms:**
- Web (browsers like Chrome, Firefox, Safari).
- Android (8.0+).

## Features

- **Image Import**: Upload photos from your device. (Direct camera capture and video frame extraction are planned future enhancements for the web version; Android wrapper may offer platform-specific capabilities).
- **3D Editor**: Manually position, rotate, and scale images in a CSS3D-based virtual space using mouse gestures (drag, wheel with modifier keys). Basic touch interactions may work for dragging.
- **Navigation**: Explore the 3D model with camera controls (pan, zoom, rotate). Includes a dedicated navigation mode that disables editing and shows image descriptions on hover/click.
- **AI Processing**: Generate detailed textual descriptions of images using the Gemini API (cloud-based).
- **Prompting**: Query the world model with natural language (e.g., "Describe the layout" or "Simulate removing an object") via Gemini API.
- **Storage & Export**: Local persistence using IndexedDB. Export models as JSON files and the current 3D view as a PNG image (experimental).
- **Project Comparison**: Load an exported JSON project file to compare its image descriptions against the current project.
- **Cross-Platform**: Shared codebase for web and Android, with minimal platform-specific code.
- **Minimal Dependencies**: No external libraries—pure vanilla JS/CSS/HTML for core functionality.

## Technologies

- **Core**: JavaScript (vanilla), HTML5, CSS3 (with 3D transforms).
- **AI Integration**: Google Gemini API (requires user-provided API key).
- **Storage**: IndexedDB (browser standard).
- **Android Wrapper**: Java with Android WebView for native integration (file access, permissions).
- **No Frameworks/Libraries**: Designed for minimalism; no Three.js, React, or other dependencies.

## Installation

### Web Version
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/USERNAME/REPOSITORY.git # Replace USERNAME/REPOSITORY with the actual path
   ```
2. Open `src/index.html` in a modern web browser.
3. (Optional) Host on a static server (e.g., GitHub Pages) for online access. The app includes a `manifest.json` for Progressive Web App (PWA) capabilities, allowing it to be "installed" on supported browsers.
    - **Note for PWA Icons**: The PWA manifest (`src/manifest.json`) references icons in `src/assets/icons/`. Placeholder files have been created. You should replace `src/assets/icons/icon-192x192.png` and `src/assets/icons/icon-512x512.png` with your actual application icons.
4. Enter your Gemini API key in the app's settings page to enable AI features.

### Android Version
1. Clone the repository (if not already done).
2. Open the Android project in Android Studio (located in the `android/` directory).
3. **Configure Signing (First Time Only)**:
    - Before building a release APK, you need to set up signing credentials. The `android/app/build.gradle` file contains placeholder signing configurations.
    - You will need to generate a Java Keystore (JKS) file. For example:
      ```bash
      keytool -genkey -v -keystore promptworld-release-key.keystore -alias promptworldalias -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000
      ```
    - Place the generated `promptworld-release-key.keystore` file in the `android/app/` directory (or your chosen location).
    - **Securely** update `android/app/build.gradle` or (preferably) your `~/.gradle/gradle.properties` file or environment variables with your actual `storeFile` path (if different), `storePassword`, `keyAlias`, and `keyPassword`. **Do not commit your actual passwords or keystore file to version control.**
4. **Build the Release APK**:
    - In Android Studio: Select "Build > Generate Signed Bundle / APK...", choose "APK", and follow the prompts, selecting the release signing configuration you set up.
    - Or, from the command line within the `android/` directory:
      ```bash
      ./gradlew assembleRelease
      ```
    - The signed APK will be located in `android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/`.
    - **Note**: The build process now automatically copies the necessary web assets from the main `src/` directory into the Android app's assets folder.
4. Install the APK on an Android device or emulator (Android 8.0+).
5. Grant permissions for storage and internet when prompted.
6. The app loads the web assets locally; enter your Gemini API key in settings.

**Note**: The Android version uses a WebView to run the same HTML/JS/CSS code as the web version. Web assets are bundled in the APK's `assets/` folder.

## Usage

### Quick Start
1. **Create a Project**: From the home screen, click "New Project" and name it.
2. **Import Images**: Upload image files from your device.
3. **Edit in 3D**: Drag images into the 3D space; use mouse gestures (Shift+Drag for Y-axis rotation, Alt+Drag for Z-axis movement, Wheel over image for scale) to adjust position/rotation/scale.
4. **Process with AI**: Select images and generate descriptions (internet required).
5. **Navigate & Prompt**: Switch to Navigation Mode in the editor to explore and view image descriptions on hover/click, or use the "Prompt World Model" screen with its chat interface to query the model (e.g., "List all furniture").
6. **Export & Compare**: Save your model as JSON or export the current view as a PNG from the editor. You can also compare your current project with a previously exported JSON project using the "Compare" feature.

### Settings
- **API Key**: Required for AI features. Obtain from Google Cloud Console (Gemini API).
- **Offline Mode**: Basic editing works offline; AI requires internet.

### Examples
- **Home Management**: Organize room photos, prompt for object inventories, simulate renovations.
- **Prototyping**: Build rough spatial models for design ideas.

### Building & Testing
- **Web**: Test in browser; use developer tools for debugging.
- **Android**: Use Android Studio; test on devices for gestures and permissions.
- **Code Style**: Follow vanilla JS best practices; comment heavily.

### Limitations
- CSS3D 3D may have rendering quirks on older browsers or devices.
- AI processing is cloud-only (requires Gemini API key and internet).
- Video frame extraction and direct camera capture are not yet implemented in the core web application.
- Touch-based 3D manipulation beyond basic dragging might be limited; primary interaction is optimized for mouse.
- PNG export of the 3D view is experimental and may not perfectly capture complex scenes.
